# React Native Playground [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pedrovgs/ReactNativePlayground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pedrovgs/ReactNativePlayground)

Playground used to learn and experiment with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). This repository contains a bunch of pull requests documenting and implementing the process of how to create a React Native application with different features.
